## Gameplay
Color Runner is a first-person shooter with advanced movement. The player will sprint, slide, and wall run through a timed obstacle course. The player can switch between four weapon types (projectile, full-auto hitscan, burst hitscan, and shotgun hitscan), each with a different color. The player must shoot targets of the same color as their weapon, and three seconds are added to their time for every target missed. Their best time is saved and displayed in the top-right of the screen. The game was developed in Unreal Engine with Blueprint visual scripting.  

Note: I am currently keeping this closed source, as this is a concept I would like to expand upon into a full game with enemies and AI.
